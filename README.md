## My process

### Built with

- Vue
- TailwindCss
- Flexbox
### What I learned
The layout of this project is very interesting, with very different configurations on mobile and desktop. I spent a lot of time thinking about the layout. In terms of form validation, I also needed to consider multiple scenarios, which made me realize many details that I had initially overlooked. When writing regular expressions, I leveraged the power of ChatGPT to save me a lot of time.
